# Optimization Algorithms in Python with Interactive Visualizations

Welcome to my repository of optimization algorithms! In this repository, you'll find a collection of Python scripts that implement various optimization algorithms, including gradient descent, conjugate gradient, and Nelder-Mead. I've also included interactive visualizations of these algorithms using Plotly, so you can see how they work in action.

My goal with this repository is to provide a resource for students and researchers interested in optimization, and to make it easy for people to understand and experiment with different algorithms. I hope that my visualizations and clear, well-documented code will make it easy for you to learn about and compare different optimization methods.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find my repository useful!
