# Explore a Wide Range of Optimization Techniques in Python with Plotly Visualizations and Clear Descriptions

This repository is a collection of optimization and search algorithms written in Python, along with accompanying visualizations created using Plotly. The included algorithms cover a range of approaches, including gradient descent, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. Each algorithm is accompanied by a Python script that demonstrates its usage and provides a clear and interactive visualization of the optimization process using Plotly. In addition to the code, this repository also includes a detailed description of each algorithm, explaining the underlying principles and key features. These resources are designed to be useful for students and practitioners looking to learn about and compare different optimization techniques. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced user, this repository has something to offer.
