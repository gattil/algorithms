# A Comprehensive Collection of Optimization Algorithms in Python

This repository contains a collection of optimization and search algorithms written in Python, along with accompanying visualizations created using Plotly. The included algorithms cover a range of approaches, including gradient descent, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. Each algorithm is accompanied by a Python script that demonstrates its usage and provides a visualization of the optimization process using Plotly. These scripts provide a useful resource for students and practitioners looking to understand and compare different optimization techniques. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn about optimization or an experienced practitioner looking to implement these algorithms in your work, this repository has something to offer.
