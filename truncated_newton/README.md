# Optimizing Functions with Truncated Newton in scipy.optimize.minimize

## Overview
When you have a function that you want to minimize, the TNC algorithm can be used to find the point where the function has the smallest possible value. This point is called the minimum of the function.

To find the minimum of a function, the TNC algorithm uses a technique called Newton's method. This method starts with an initial guess for the location of the minimum and then uses the gradient of the function (a measure of how steep the function is at a particular point) to move closer to the minimum. The algorithm repeats this process until it gets very close to the minimum and can't move any closer.

The TNC algorithm is a variant of Newton's method that is used when the function is twice differentiable (meaning that it has second-order partial derivatives). It works by approximating the Hessian matrix (a matrix of second-order partial derivatives) using finite differences and using this approximate Hessian to update the guess for the location of the minimum.

## Usage
The Truncated Newton (TNC) algorithm is an optimization method that is used to find the minimum of a function that is twice differentiable. It is a variant of Newton's method, which is a widely-used optimization algorithm that involves iteratively updating an estimate of the minimum point using the gradient of the function and the Hessian matrix (a matrix of second-order partial derivatives).

The TNC algorithm differs from Newton's method in that it does not update the Hessian matrix at each iteration. Instead, it approximates the Hessian using finite differences and uses this approximate Hessian to update the estimate of the minimum point. This can make the TNC algorithm faster than other Newton-based methods, but it may also make it less accurate.

## Example
Here is an example of how you might use the TNC algorithm with scipy.optimize.minimize:

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize


def objective_function(x):
    # define your objective function here
    return f(x)


# set the initial starting point for the optimization
x0 = [0, 0, 0]

# use the TNC algorithm to find the minimum of the objective function
result = minimize(objective_function, x0, method="TNC")

# get the minimum value of the objective function
minimum_value = result.fun

# get the values of the variables at the minimum
minimum_point = result.x
```

The result object returned by the minimize function contains information about the optimization process, such as the final value of the objective function and the values of the variables at the minimum. You can access this information using the attributes of the result object, such as result.fun for the minimum value of the objective function and result.x for the values of the variables at the minimum.

## Remark

The scipy.optimize.minimize function is used to find the minimum value of a function. It has many possible solvers that can be used to find this minimum. One of these solvers is the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method, which is a gradient-based optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. Another solver is the Truncated Newton (TNC) method, which is a modified Newton's method that uses a truncated Taylor series expansion to approximate the Hessian matrix (the matrix of second partial derivatives of a function).

The CG method is based on finding the minimum of a function by following the negative gradient of the function, while the TNC method uses Newton's method, which involves finding the minimum by using information about the Hessian matrix of the function. The CG method is generally faster than the TNC method, but the TNC method is more accurate and may converge to the minimum faster in some cases.
